First of all, we put him in the hospital
And withdraw all television, I see

Is Dexter ill? Is Dexter ill? Is Dexter ill
Is Dexter ill today, Mr Kirt, Dexter's in school?
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishpaw
Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand
The Baltimore County school board have decided to expel
Dexter from the entire public school system
Oh Mr. Kirt, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy
But surely, expulsion is not the answer
I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer
It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane
That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut, you're crazy in the coconut
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Grab a kazoo, let's have a duel, now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy, boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet and he also made false teeth
Avalanches is above, business continues below
Did I ever tell you the story about
Cowboys, m-m-midgets, the Indians and, Fron, Frontier Psychiatrist
I, I felt strangely hypnotised
I was in another world, a world of 20,000 girls
And milk Rectangles, to an optometrist, the man with the golden eyeball
And tighten your buttocks, pour juice on your chin
I promise my girlfriend I'd, the violin, violin, violin
Frontier Psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier
That boy needs therapy, psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy, purely psychosomatic

Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut you're crazy in the coconut
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Ranagazoo, let's have a tune, now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy, boy needs therapy
He was white as a sheet and he also made false teeth

Can you think of anything else that talks, other than a person?
A-a-a bird? Yeah, sometimes a parrot talks
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Yes, some birds are funny when they talk
Can you think of anything else? Um, a record, record, record

Well, I would say, "Bon Voyage"
Take a little journey
Journey, journey, journey
